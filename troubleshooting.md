## Troubleshooting:

### Static files:

To address the image issue. You have a few options to handle this:

1. Update Vue Router Base URL:
   If you're using Vue Router, you can set the base URL to '/static/'. In your Vue app's router configuration:

   ```javascript
   const router = createRouter({
     history: createWebHistory('/static/'),
     routes: [
       // your routes
     ]
   })
   ```

   This will prepend '/static/' to all your asset URLs.

2. Use Django Template Tags:
   If you're rendering the initial HTML through Django, you can use Django's template tags to generate the correct URLs:

   ```html
   <img src="{% static 'logo.png' %}" alt="Logo">
   ```

   This requires that you process your index.html through Django's template engine.

3. Update Asset References in Vue Components:
   In your Vue components, update the image sources to include the '/static/' prefix:

   ```vue
   <template>
     <img src="/static/logo.png" alt="Logo">
   </template>
   ```

4. Use Webpack/Vite Public Path:
   If you're using Webpack or Vite, you can set the public path to '/static/'. In your Vite config:

   ```javascript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/static/',
     // other config options
   })
   ```

   For Webpack:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     output: {
       publicPath: '/static/',
     },
     // other config options
   }
   ```

5. Use a Computed Property or Method:
   Create a method or computed property in your Vue components to prepend '/static/' to asset URLs:

   ```vue
   <template>
     <img :src="getAssetUrl('logo.png')" alt="Logo">
   </template>

   <script>
   export default {
     methods: {
       getAssetUrl(asset) {
         return `/static/${asset}`;
       }
     }
   }
   </script>
   ```

The best option depends on your specific setup:

- If you're serving the initial HTML through Django and can process it as a template, option 2 is clean and straightforward.
- If you're building a pure SPA and don't want to process the HTML through Django, options 1 or 4 are good choices.
- If you need more flexibility or are dealing with dynamic asset paths, option 5 might be preferable.

Given your current setup, I would recommend trying option 4 (updating the Webpack/Vite public path) first. This should handle most asset references automatically without requiring changes to your Vue components. If that doesn't cover all cases, you can fall back to option 5 for any remaining issues.

Remember to rebuild your Vue app after making these changes, and run `python manage.py collectstatic` again to ensure all updated files are collected into your Django static files directory.

### Server Error (500):

When you set `DEBUG=False` in a Django production environment and encounter a "Server Error (500)" message, it generally indicates a problem that is not being fully revealed due to the lack of detailed error reporting in production mode. Here are some common causes and how to address them:

### 1. **Incorrect Template Configuration**
   **Cause:** When `DEBUG=False`, Django requires an explicit configuration of `ALLOWED_HOSTS`, and if there’s an issue with how templates are found and rendered, it could lead to a 500 error.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is correctly set to a list of hostnames that your site will serve.
   - Verify that your template directories are correctly specified in `TEMPLATES` settings.
   - Confirm that all required template files are present and accessible with correct permissions.

   Example:
   ```python
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['yourdomain.com', 'www.yourdomain.com']
   ```

### 2. **Static Files Not Served Properly**
   **Cause:** In production, static files are not served automatically by Django as they are in development. If your static files are not correctly handled, it can lead to missing CSS, JS, or images, which might not cause a 500 error directly, but could lead to unhandled exceptions.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to gather all static files into the directory specified by `STATIC_ROOT`.
   - Ensure your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) is configured to serve static files from the location specified by `STATIC_ROOT`.

   Example:
   ```python
   STATIC_ROOT = '/path/to/staticfiles/'
   ```

### 3. **Improperly Configured Logging**
   **Cause:** With `DEBUG=False`, errors are not shown in the browser. If logging is not properly configured, you won't know what the error is.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Configure logging to ensure errors are recorded in a log file or sent to an error monitoring service.
   
   Example:
   ```python
   LOGGING = {
       'version': 1,
       'disable_existing_loggers': False,
       'handlers': {
           'file': {
               'level': 'ERROR',
               'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
               'filename': '/path/to/error.log',
           },
       },
       'loggers': {
           'django': {
               'handlers': ['file'],
               'level': 'ERROR',
               'propagate': True,
           },
       },
   }
   ```

### 4. **Database Issues**
   **Cause:** There could be problems connecting to the database, especially if the credentials, host, or other settings are incorrect.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Verify that your `DATABASES` setting is correctly configured for your production environment.
   - Ensure your database is up and running, and the Django project has the correct privileges.

   Example:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'yourdbname',
           'USER': 'yourdbuser',
           'PASSWORD': 'yourdbpassword',
           'HOST': 'yourdbhost',
           'PORT': 'yourdbport',
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Missing or Incorrectly Set Environment Variables**
   **Cause:** Environment variables like `SECRET_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc., might not be set correctly in the production environment.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set and accessible to your Django application.
   - Check that `SECRET_KEY` is set to a secure, unique value.

   Example:
   ```python
   import os
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', 'your-fallback-secret-key')
   ```

### 6. **Middleware Issues**
   **Cause:** Certain middleware might cause issues when `DEBUG=False`, especially if they rely on certain settings that are only active in development.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Review your `MIDDLEWARE` settings to ensure all middleware are compatible with a production environment.
   - Disable or properly configure any middleware that might cause issues.

### 7. **CSRF Protection**
   **Cause:** When `DEBUG=False`, Django’s CSRF protection becomes stricter. If your templates or forms are not correctly including CSRF tokens, this can lead to 500 errors.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure all forms include the `{% csrf_token %}` template tag.
   - Verify that any AJAX requests include the CSRF token in headers.

### 8. **File Permissions**
   **Cause:** Incorrect file or directory permissions, especially on static, media, or template files, can result in a 500 error.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure that the user running your Django application has the appropriate read and write permissions on necessary files and directories.
   - Check that the `MEDIA_ROOT` and `STATIC_ROOT` are correctly set and accessible.

### 9. **Third-Party Services or APIs**
   **Cause:** If your application relies on third-party services or APIs and there’s an issue with the connection (e.g., wrong keys, service downtime), it could cause a 500 error.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure all third-party service credentials are correctly configured.
   - Implement error handling around API calls to prevent them from causing unhandled exceptions.

### 10. **Caching Issues**
   **Cause:** If caching is not properly configured, it can lead to issues when `DEBUG=False`.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Verify that your caching backend is configured correctly in `CACHES` settings.
   - Clear the cache to ensure stale data isn’t causing issues.

   Example:
   ```python
   CACHES = {
       'default': {
           'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache',
           'LOCATION': '127.0.0.1:11211',
       }
   }
   ```

### 11. **Missing or Incorrect WSGI/ASGI Configuration**
   **Cause:** The WSGI or ASGI settings might not be correctly configured, leading to issues when serving the application.
   
   **Solution:**
   - Ensure that your WSGI or ASGI application is correctly configured and that your web server (e.g., Gunicorn, Daphne) is correctly pointing to the Django project’s WSGI/ASGI application.

### 12. **Gunicorn or Web Server Misconfiguration**
   **Cause:** Issues with Gunicorn, Daphne, or your web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) can lead to a 500 error if not configured correctly for production.

   **Solution:**
   - Verify your Gunicorn or web server configuration files.
   - Ensure that your web server is correctly forwarding requests to your Django application and that the application is responding as expected.

### Conclusion:
To effectively troubleshoot issues, start by checking the server logs (which should be configured as per point 3). Logs often provide clues to the underlying issue. Additionally, you can temporarily set `DEBUG=True` (on a non-production environment) to get detailed error messages, but be sure to revert this after identifying the issue.

## Dynamically resolve static assets
To automate the process of updating the `index.html` file with the correct hashed asset filenames generated by Vite, you have several options. Below is one approache you can consider:

### **Use Django Template Tags with Manifest File**
Vite can generate a `manifest.json` file that maps the original filenames to the hashed ones. You can use this manifest file to dynamically include the correct assets in your Django templates.

#### Steps:
1. **Configure Vite to generate a manifest file**:
   In your `vite.config.js`, enable the `manifest` option:
   ```javascript
   export default {
     build: {
       manifest: true,
       outDir: 'dist',  // The output directory for static files
       //rollupOptions: {
       //  input: '/src/main.js',  // Your main entry file
       //}
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create a custom Django template tag**:
   Create a custom template tag that reads the `manifest.json` and returns the correct file path.

   ```python
   # yourapp/templatetags/vite_assets.py
   import json
   from django import template
   from django.conf import settings
   from django.templatetags.static import static

   register = template.Library()

   @register.simple_tag
   def vite_js(path):
       # Load the manifest file (this may need to be ajusted)
       manifest_path = settings.BASE_DIR / 'dist' / '.vite' / 'manifest.json'
       with open(manifest_path) as f:
           manifest = json.load(f)
       
       # Return the static file path (please check your own specific assets files)
       return static(manifest[path]['file'])
   ```

3. **Update your `index.html` to use the custom tag**:
   Modify your `templates/index.html` to use this custom template tag:
   ```html
   {% load vite_assets %}
   <!doctype html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>TalentCampus</title>
       <script type="module" crossorigin src="{% vite_js 'path/to/main.js' %}"></script>
       <link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="{% vite_css 'path/to/main.css' %}">
     </head>
     <body>
       <div id="app"></div>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

#### Pros:
- **Dynamic**: Automatically uses the correct hashed filenames without manual intervention.
- **Django-integrated**: Utilizes Django's template system, making it easy to manage within the Django project.

#### Cons:
- **Setup Complexity**: Requires custom Django template tags and some configuration in Vite.
- **Potential for Errors**: Mistakes in the template tag could cause issues in loading assets.

### Conclusion

The best option depends on your specific needs. However, if you prefer to keep everything within Django's ecosystem and want a dynamic solution this one could be your best option.
